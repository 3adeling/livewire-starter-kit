# Laravel + Livewire Starter Kit

## Introduction

Our Laravel + [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a Livewire frontend.

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page Livewire applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of Livewire combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This Livewire starter kit utilizes Livewire 3 and the Composition API, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [shadcn-Livewire](https://www.shadcn-Livewire.com) component library.
